# Comparing Suicide Rates of Countries on various factors



This program compares the suicide rates of countries based on the percentage of Muslim population of these countries. A scatter plot it used to show the comparison.

The aim of the visualisation was to provide an answer to the question of whether the suicide rate varies with the percentage of Muslim population in a country. The crude suicide rate data was downloaded as csv file from the World Health Organisation and the data on religious composition of countries was downloaded from the Pew Research website. The data for religious composition doesn't provide exact figures when the percentage is < 1 or >99. For such cases the percentage was rounded off to 0 and 100 respectively. Data for both religious composition and suicide rates is from the year 2010.

The scatter plot does seem to provide a clear indication that countries with high proportion of Muslims tend to have lower suicide rates (with the notable exception of Kazakhstan). Now it is beyond the scope of this project to show the absence or presence of causality. However, possibly there are other factors involved. For example, a scatter plot of country latitude vs suicide rates also shows a relationship (Again, possibly related to the fact that most Muslim majority countries are situated in the tropics). The plot shows 177 countries.
